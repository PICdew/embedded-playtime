Some of my embedded code

This is a collection of embedded code that I have developed to various levels since 2009, some of it is very rough and quite nasty but others I am pleased with. I will add to it as and when.

=================

ADXL345sb

This is an mbed library to interact with the ADXL345 accelerometer

=================

DS18B20_Onewire

This is a PIC microcontroller library that is dependant on the HITECH C compiler (or though would be very easy to modify)

=================

bitbanged_EUART_transmit.c

This is a simple way to get the transmit half of a serial link up and running on a PIC that doesn't have a EUART/EUSART

=================

thermistor.c

Basic code which uses a PIC to sample and calculate the temperature measure by a thermistor
